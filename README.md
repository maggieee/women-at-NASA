# Women @ NASA

Documenting the women at NASA throughout history, using the https://images-api.nasa.gov API.  

Code for project hosted on [Github here](https://github.com/maggieee/women-at-NASA/). This project can be visited live at [http://15.222.211.225/](http://15.222.211.225/). 

This application fetches data using https://images-api.nasa.gov's search API to find all photos that result from a keyword search for "women". The app uses **React** to create Components for year buttons that can be selected to filter which image cards (also React Components) are displayed. We pass props and state throughout the app using five Components (App, YearButton, YearButtonContainer, NasaImage, and NasaImageContainer). Other technologies used include **Bootstrap**, **CSS**, **HTML**, **Flask**, and **Python** (to run the Flask server and render the homepage). Hope you enjoy!
